        <p>Something bad happened to me when I was in semester 1. I was warded because of mental health issues. And it really made me feel so much pressure because I am the oldest daughter, so my both parents really want to see me succeed that semester, but instead of being in class, I was in the ward instead. It's really hard when I have to face this all alone, but..</p>

        <p>I got up on my own and collected all those broken pieces and became a new me! Thanks to myself because until this day, I can go through ups and downs alone and get stronger every day. I have this motivational speech for those who read this: "You are capable of achieving anything you set your mind to. The challenges you face will not define you. Believe in your abilities, and know that you have what it takes to face them head-on". Alhamdulillah, my pointer for semester 1, 2, and 3 are maintained 3 above!.</p>
